# Usage with Nix

## [justinwoo/psc-package2nix](https://github.com/justinwoo/psc-package2nix) (Older)

Justin Woo has made a psc-package2nix project for generating nix derivations from Psc-Package dependencies: <https://github.com/justinwoo/psc-package2nix>

## [justinwoo/soba](https://github.com/justinwoo/soba) (Newer)

Because of the relative rarity in using psc-package with Nix, there is not excessive documentation on how to use this tool. See mostly the `soba insdhall` and `soba nix` commands in this tool.
